# The Code for Miami Civic Hack Night Guide Book

Contributors: Chris Scott, Ernie Hsiung

## Preparing for Future Hack Nights

Some MeetUps such as Maptime Miami will require speakers with presentations, 
other "special edition" hack nights will have special guests that want to
do a whole shindig. In those cases we will need a much bigger room inside the
CIC. 

For that, you will need to contact Sally Guzik (guzik@cictr.com). Please 
CC the co-captains if you do this (Cristina and Ernie).


## Running the Hack Night

What do you do when you find yourself at Civic Hack Night and there are no 
core members around? You follow these simple steps to a succesful hack night.

1. **Check Slack**

  Message a core member on the Code for Miami slack, and someone will get back to you. 

2. **Check with CIC Miami Staff to verify space**
   We have moved from The LAB Miami to CIC Miami, which is more structured 
   on how meeting space is reserved. For regular Hack Nights, we should 
   always have The Little Haiti Conference room.
   
   If there is a presentation, advance preperation is strongly suggested. 

3. **Wayfinding (Set up Signs)**
   It's not obvious how to get to the Little Haiti room. We Make signs for 
   when people get off the elevator as well as a sign for the door 
   since people often pass right by it. This is the sign (19MB TIFF file) 
   Cristina prints out and sticks in front of the elevators that will be
   shared on this repo; Cristina usually tapes the sign right by the sign
   saying "Conference Rooms C & D."
   
4. **Pizza**
  
  If this is a hack night chances are there will be pizza on the way.
  Sign for it give a 3 dollar tip.

  If they need ID verification, message the person on slack for an ETA. 
  
5. **Introduction**

  Grab a white board write wifi password on it. 
  Write slack channel invite url `http://cfm-invite.herokuapp.com`
  and then begin introductions.
  
  Here's a handy script to follow.
    ```
    Hi, welcome to Code For Miami / Open Hack. We are going to start with some short introductions.
    
    If you are regular what's your name role and project. 
    If you are new just your name and new member.
    
    ```
    
    Go clockwise starting with yourself.
    
    ```
    
    I'm [ Name ],[ Role ] on [ Project Name ]
    
    ```

  Ask if they are any announcements or project updates.
