### Don't Panic

What do you do when you find yourself at Civic Hack Night
and they are no core members around? 

You follow these simple steps to a succesful hack night.

1. **Check Slack**

  Message a core member on slack some one will get back to you. 

2. **Check with Lab Staff to verify space**
