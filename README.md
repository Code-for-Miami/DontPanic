# The Code for Miami Civic Hack Night Guide Book

Contributors: Chris Scott, Ernie Hsiung

## Preparing for Future Hack Nights

Some MeetUps such as Maptime Miami will require speakers with presentations, 
other "special edition" hack nights will have special guests that want to
do a whole shindig. In those cases we will need a much bigger room inside the
CIC. 

For that, you will need to contact Sally Guzik (guzik@cictr.com). Please 
CC the co-captains if you do this (Cristina and Ernie).


## Running the Hack Night

What do you do when you find yourself at Civic Hack Night and there are no 
core members around? You follow these simple steps to a succesful hack night.

1. **Check Slack**

  Message a core member on the Code for Miami slack, and someone will get back to you. 

2. **Check with CIC Miami Staff to verify space**
   
   We have moved from The LAB Miami to CIC Miami, which is more structured 
   on how meeting space is reserved. For regular Hack Nights, we should 
   always have The Little Haiti Conference room.
   
   If there is a presentation, advance preperation is strongly suggested. 

3. **Wayfinding**
   
   We are now meeting at the much more obvious Amazon meeting room on the
   sixth floor. There should be maps around the lobby. And if nothing else,
   if you want to branch off you can work in the cafe space right behind
   the reception area!
   
4. **Pizza**
  
  If you are ordering pizza: have it delivered to CIC, 6th floor. Let the
  lobby security know so they can send them on their way.
  
  If you know pizza is coming but didn't order it: chances are there will 
  be pizza on the way. Sign for it give a 3 dollar tip.

  If they need ID verification, message the person on slack for an ETA. 
  
5. **Introduction**

  Grab a white board write wifi password on it. 
  Write slack channel invite url `http://cfm-invite.herokuapp.com`
  and then begin introductions.
  
  Here's a handy script to follow.
    ```
    Hi, welcome to Code For Miami / Open Hack. We are going to start with some short introductions.
    
    If you are regular what's your name role and project. 
    If you are new just your name and new member.
    
    ```
    
    Go clockwise starting with yourself.
    
    ```
    
    I'm [ Name ],[ Role ] on [ Project Name ]
    
    ```

  Ask if they are any announcements or project updates.
